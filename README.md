[4nderground](https://www.4nderground.com) (pronounced "underground") is an audio-streaming platform that minimizes the complexity of music sharing. We do this by opting for a player that plays user-provided uploads simply from newest to oldest instead of using any fancy algorithms or charts and by only asking for an audio file and, optionally, a genre, to upload.
